<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology extends the SAREF ontology for the industry and manufacturing domain and has been developed in the context of the STF 534 (https://portal.etsi.org/STF/STFs/STFHomePages/STF534.aspx). SAREF4INMA describes production equipment in factories and allows to trace back and monitor production process measurements. Moreover, it describes a factory layout in order to be able to locate each production equipment in a factory. It is worth mentioning that this ontology was generated based on real-world use cases provided by domain experts and on several standards and industry 4.0 initiatives, such as Platform Industrie 4.0 from Germany.</span>
